GameLeaderboardMockupA high-performance leaderboard system built with ASP.NET Core MVC. This project is specifically architected to demonstrate scalable system design, clean code principles, and decoupled business logic for modern gaming environments.🏗️ Architectural FocusUnlike standard CRUD applications, this project emphasizes System Architecture and Design:Decoupled Logic: Separation of concerns between data persistence, business rules, and UI rendering.Scalability: Designed to handle high-concurrency score updates and real-time ranking.Extensibility: Modular structure allowing for easy integration of new features like global tournaments or regional filtering.Clean Code: Strict adherence to SOLID principles and the Repository Pattern.🏆 Achievement System LogicThe system includes a Rule-Based Evaluation Engine that monitors player statistics to trigger milestones dynamically:Logic CategoriesThreshold Evaluation: * Logic: Triggers when a cumulative metric meets a defined constant ($x \ge \text{target}$).Example: "Centurion" – Awarded at 100 total wins.Streak Maintenance: * Logic: Increments a counter on success and resets to zero on failure; unlocks rewards at $n$ consecutive successes.Example: "Unstoppable" – Awarded for a 10-game win streak.Performance Ratios: * Logic: Calculates skill-based efficiency (e.g., $\frac{\text{Total Score}}{\text{Games Played}}$) to award rank-based titles.🛠️ Technology StackFramework: .NET 8.0 / ASP.NET Core MVCLanguage: C#Pattern: Repository & Unit of WorkFrontend: Razor Views, Bootstrap, CSS3🚀 Getting StartedClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GameLeaderboardMockup.git
